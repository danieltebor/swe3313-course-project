# Technology Selection

C# and the ASP.NET Core framework were chosen because of their development tools, cross-platform support, and smooth integration. The Blazor Server framework was chosen since it uses C# and serves the functionality of accessing a database, which most website interactions require.

JSON was chosen for database implementation because it is easy to use and robust enough for the project requirements.
### Operating Environment
C#, ASP.NET, and Blazor are cross-platform and can be integrated on most popular operating systems.
