## Introducing Hank's Mineral Emporium
Welcome to the project repository for team NullPointerException! All project artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project are located here. We will be creating a small e-commerce website using ASPNET Core and JSON to sell special minerals. This repo contains the source code for Hank's Mineral Imporium. Hank from Breaking Bad needs to sell his mineral collection and has tasked us with creating a website for him.
